\section{Modeling}\label{sec:modeling}
%As seen in \cref{tab:cp-result}, our model accuratly emulates reality to a margin of PLACEHOLDER. It is however importen to keep in mind that the the comparison was done upon a relatively simple and linear system. So we can not be certain that our model would fare as well as it did for this configuration on a more complex configuration. This way of verifying if the model accuratly emulates reality also only work if the items ordered on the real systems a scheduled in a optimal way. As UPPAAL will generate the fastest trace. There are also certain behavious that a factory could have, such as independent queues for items in work and items who want to travel through, that we have not implemented in our model. Adding our removing such behaviours could change the outcome of this evalutation. We however feel confident that our model is capable of accurately mimic the most common modular factories.
