This report is written by project group d701e16 at Aalborg University as part of the 1st semester of the Master of Computer Science. The group has two members consisting of Alexander Brandborg and Mathias Claus Jensen. The topic of the semester was \textit{Reality to Models}, and the chosen project proposal was \textit{Model and Optimization of Production}. In this report we describe, how we develop a model of modular factories, and use it find the optimal factory configuration for producing an order of items. 

We would like to thank our supervisor SÃ¸ren Enevoldsen for his support and advice. Fellow student Martin Kristjansen gets our thanks for sparring with us during the semester. Thanks goes to Kim G. Larsen for his initial input to the project. Lastly we would like to thank Ole Madsen and Casper Schou from Aalborg University's \textit{Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering} for answering our questions, and allowing us to inspect the department's CP Learning Factor set-up. 

Both the UPPAAL model and python scripts refered to in the report can be found at \url{ https://github.com/mathiascj/d701e16.git}.
