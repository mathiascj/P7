%The \emph{coster template} ensures that parallel processing of recipes is prefered, during a best-first Search. It can be seen in \cref{fig:firstcoster} The \emph{coster template} is initialised with a rate \emph{c}, which increases the \emph{cost} variable as a function of the global time passed. Without this, the search would not have any reason to run several modules at the same time as the final \emph{cost} would not change. By having a constant \emph{cost} on the factoryâ€™s operating time, we make the prospect of parallel processing a prefered option.
