\chapter{Transformation of Configurations} \label{ch:configuration}
We have now implemented a UPPAAL model, which we can use to find the shortest time it takes for a configuration to produce a given order. We wish to use this tool in order pick the optimal configuration to perform some kind of order, when we have access to a given set of modules. In this chapter we will formally describe, how we from a simple initial configuration may produce other configurations. Being able to generate different configurations, we are able to compare them, and pick the candidate with the best rating.
