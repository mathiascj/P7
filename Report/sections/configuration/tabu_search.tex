\section{Tabu search} \label{ch:tabu_search}
In this section we will the describe the method we used for finding an optimized configuration. We will be using local search using the rules set up in \cref{sec:math_rules} to define our neighbours. The specfic kind of search we will be using is Tabu search, as simply using local search a lone will likely end up in a local maximum. Tabu search can escape local maximum by allowing the search to go to neighbours with worse fitness, or it can go back to a previously tried neighbour and take a new possible route from there.
